# iskhubslow-multipleservers

For the IsKHubSlow API and its docs, please visit [xyr11/iskhubslow](https://github.com/xyr11/iskhubslow)

The code here serves as "branches" for receiving API requests that the main server can choose from.
This is primarily for reliability and redundancy of the API so that the load can be spread across different servers.
